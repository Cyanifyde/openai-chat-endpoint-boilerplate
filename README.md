# GPT-3.5-Turbo / GPT-4 Chatbot Boilerplate

This repository contains a simple Python-based boilerplate code for using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 model to create a chatbot. This chatbot utilizes the OpenAI API and Tiktoken library to manage tokens and costs.

## Getting Started

Before you can use this boilerplate, you'll need to set up a few things:

1. Sign up for an [OpenAI account](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and obtain an API key.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install openai tiktoken python-dotenv`.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lablab-ai/openai-chat-endpoint-boilerplate.git
   cd openai-chat-endpoint-boilerplate
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

3. Run the chatbot script:
   ```
   python openai-chat-endpoint-boilerplate.py
   ```

4. Start chatting with the bot by running the openai-chat-endpoint-boilerplate.py file
